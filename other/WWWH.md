# <div align='center'> WWWH Protocol: My Coding Learning Journey </div>

## Introduction

Welcome to my WWWH (What, Why, When, How) protocol documentation! This file serves as a record of my coding journey, capturing the essence of each concept I encounter and learn.

### What is WWWH?

WWWH is a simple yet powerful learning framework that helps me thoroughly understand and document coding concepts:

- **What**: Define the concept
- **Why**: Explain its importance
- **When**: Describe when to use it
- **How**: Demonstrate its implementation

By consistently applying this protocol, I aim to build a comprehensive knowledge base that not only helps me retain information but also serves as a quick reference for future projects.
